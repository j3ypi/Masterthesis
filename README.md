# Development of computer-based tasks for patients with unilateral right-hemispheric neglect

## A study to examine the degree of automation through velocity and acceleration on healthy participants

### Abstract:
Unilateral right-hemispheric neglect is one of the most common neuropsychological
diseases as a condition after a stroke. It is characterized by the negligence of one
half of perception without consciously noticing it, with the possible additional involvement
of motor neglect. There are still contradictory opinions about whether it is
caused solely by a shift of attention or if motor deficiencies – even within the ipsilesional
space – are always involved. Computer-based assessments offer further
insights about this question as they provide dynamic measurements such as velocity
and acceleration every few milliseconds and not only the response time of the
task itself. An efficient measurement to test for potential deficiencies is the degree
of automation. This study develops novel tablet-based tasks to diagnose neglect
patients, which are evaluated in respects of automation and other important parameters
like peak velocity, peak acceleration, and number of inversions in velocity
(NIV) on healthy participants to identify potential influencing factors. The velocity
and acceleration profile of every person should be normally distributed. It is expected
that the dependent variables peak velocity, peak acceleration, and NIV are
influenced by the extent of education and frequency of writing, but not by gender and
age when conducting a task of wave drawing. While drawing horizontal lines, peak
velocity is expected to differ between line direction but neither between age groups
nor gender. The aim of this study is to develop novel computer-based tasks and to
establish reference values for future clinical trials. 51 subjects conducted 23 tasks
with the dominant right hand and 19 tasks with the left hand on a graphical Wacom
tablet. For the task of wave drawing, every person’s velocity and acceleration profile
is investigated regarding normality with the Shapiro-Wilks test, a probability density
function, and a Q-Q plot. Furthermore, a multivariate linear regression is conducted
to investigate the influence of gender, age, years of education, and writing frequency
on the dependent variables peak velocity, peak acceleration and NIV. The evaluation
of horizontal line drawing is examined with a repeated measures ANOVA to test differences in line direction. The velocity and acceleration profiles are not sufficiently normally distributed for individuals and skewed to the left over all subjects with a
long tail to the right. Neither of the independent variables have any influence on velocity,
acceleration or NIV, whereas the ANOVA shows a significant difference in line
direction between leftward and rightward lines. The deviations from a Gaussian distribution
might be best explained by the frequently described skewness of response
times, as velocity is a function of response time. The tablet-based tasks should be
further modified after clinical trials to make sure there is a high sensitivity even with
this small number of tasks. Since there are no notable influencing factors, it can
be used for neglect patients independent of their demographics for future clinical trials.
This study paves the way for clinical use, where it might potentially increase
diagnostic sensitivity considerably. Furthermore, it might provide insights about its
cause as well as further differentiation between motor and non-motor symptoms.
